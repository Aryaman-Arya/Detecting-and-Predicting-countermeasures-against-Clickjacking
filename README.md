# Detecting and Predicting countermeasures against Clickjacking

A Clickjacking attack involves creating a malicious web page to deceive the user into making unwanted clicks that benefit the attacker. It spreads malware, steals passwords and cookies, transmits spam, and deletes personal emails, among other things. Clickjacking attacks occur when many programmes or websites share a graphical display: A principal can trick the user into interacting with user interface elements owned by another principal, initiating actions that the user did not expect.

This approach prevents websites from being Clickjacked by detecting the vulnerabilities present in the target website and then returning feedback to the host that includes the measures that could be taken to prevent their websites from being Clickjacked, a numeric value ’Level of Security’ to analyze the relative stability of the website and the possible changes that could be made to increase the ’Level of Security’ of their website.
